Originally intended for passwords utility provides a front end for a library (KeyMaster.dll) that provides a means for encrypting and hashing text. You would use this to encrypt a password or a database connection string and then paste that encrypted string into a file that's accessible at run time. 
Typically you'd include a key in the app.config file that provides the path to this file. At run time the encrypted string is passed to KeyMaster to be decrypted. If you use a specific key to encrypt the text with (it's optional) then you'd have to provide it to the user somehow (through a ReadMe file or hard coded).
