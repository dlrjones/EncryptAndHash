Originally intended for passwords, this utility provides a front end for a library (KeyMaster.dll) that provides a means for encrypting and hashing text. You would use this to encrypt a password or a database connection string and then paste that encrypted string into a file that's accessible at run time. 
Typically you'd include a key in the app.config file that provides the path to this file. At run time the encrypted string is passed to KeyMaster to be decrypted. If you use a specific key to encrypt the text with (it's optional) then you'd have to provide it to the user somehow (through a ReadMe file or hard coded).

This will also encrypt whole files. Drag and drop the files to encrypt into the text field. The resulting files appear in the same directory that they came from.
The password to encrypt these files is encrypted itself and kept in the file setup.dll in the application directory. It doesn't require a key. The intent of this feature was to encrypt the source files before moving them to GitHub.
